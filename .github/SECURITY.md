# Reporting Security Issues

Usually security issues of a deep learning project come from non-standard 3rd packages or continuous running services. 
If you are suffering from security issues from our project, please consider reporting to us. 
We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
