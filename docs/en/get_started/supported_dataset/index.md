# Supported Benchmarks

EvalScope supports a variety of datasets for evaluating different types of models, including language models, AIGC models, and other models. Below is a list of the supported datasets categorized by their respective model types.


```{tip}
If the dataset you need is not on the list, you may submit an [issue](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope/issues), and we will support it as soon as possible. Alternatively, you can refer to the [Benchmark Addition Guide](../../advanced_guides/add_benchmark.md) to add datasets by yourself and submit a [PR](https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope/pulls). Contributions are welcome.

You can also use other tools supported by this framework for evaluation, such as [OpenCompass](../../user_guides/backend/opencompass_backend.md) for language model evaluation, or [VLMEvalKit](../../user_guides/backend/vlmevalkit_backend.md) for multimodal model evaluation.
