# RAGAS

This framework supports [RAGAS](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), a dedicated framework for evaluating the performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) processes. Some of its core evaluation metrics include:

- Faithfulness: Measures the factual accuracy of generated answers, ensuring the truthfulness and reliability of the generated content.
- Answer Relevance: Assesses the relevance of answers to the given questions, verifying whether the response directly addresses the user's query.
- Context Precision: Evaluates the precision of the context used to generate answers, ensuring that relevant information is selected from the context.
- Context Relevancy: Measures the relevance of the chosen context to the question, helping to improve context selection to enhance answer accuracy.
- Context Recall: Evaluates the completeness of retrieved relevant contextual information, ensuring that no key context is omitted.

In addition, RAGAS also provides tools for automatic test data generation for user convenience.

## Environment Setup
Install dependencies

```shell
pip install ragas
```

## RAG Evaluation

### Dataset Preparation
An example of the evaluation dataset is as follows:
```json
[
    {
        "user_input": "When was the first Olympic Games held?",
        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "The first modern Olympic Games were held from April 6 to April 15, 1896, in Athens, Greece."
        ],
        "response": "The first modern Olympic Games were held on April 6, 1896.",
        "reference": "The first modern Olympic Games opened on April 6, 1896, in Athens, Greece."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "Which athlete has won the most Olympic gold medals?",
        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "Michael Phelps is the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals in history, having won a total of 23 gold medals."
        ],
        "response": "Michael Phelps has won the most Olympic gold medals.",
        "reference": "Michael Phelps is the athlete with the most Olympic gold medals, having won a total of 23 gold medals."
    }
]
```
The required fields include:
- user_input: User input
- response: Model generated answer
- retrieved_contexts: List of retrieved contexts
- reference: Standard answer

#### Automatically Generating Datasets
RAGAS provides the functionality to automatically generate test datasets. Users can specify parameters such as test set size, data distribution, LLM generators, and so on to automatically generate a test dataset. The specific steps are as follows:

```{figure} images/generation_process.png

Ragas adopts a novel approach to generating evaluation data. An ideal evaluation dataset should encompass various types of questions encountered in real-world applications, including questions of different difficulty levels. By default, large language models (LLMs) struggle to create diverse samples since they often follow common paths. Inspired by works like [Evol-Instruct](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244), Ragas achieves this goal by adopting an evolutionary generation paradigm, where questions with different characteristics (such as reasoning, conditions, multiple contexts, etc.) are systematically constructed based on the provided document set. This method ensures comprehensive coverage of the various components' performance in your pipeline, making the evaluation process more robust.

- `eval_config`: `dict`: Detailed information of the evaluation configuration.
  - `tool`: `str`: The name of the evaluation tool, "RAGAS".
  - `testset_generation`: `dict`: Configuration for test set generation.
    - `docs`: `list`: List of documents required for test set generation, e.g., ["README.md"].
    - `test_size`: `int`: Size of the generated test set, e.g., 5.
    - `output_file`: `str`: Path of the generated dataset output file, e.g., "outputs/testset.json".
    - `knowledge_graph`: `str`: The file path of the knowledge graph, e.g., "outputs/knowledge_graph.json". The knowledge graph generated during the document processing will be saved in this path. If a knowledge graph already exists at this path, it will be loaded directly, skipping the generation step of the knowledge graph.
    - `distribution`: `dict`: Configuration of the content distribution in the test set.
      - `simple`: `float`: Proportion of simple content, e.g., 0.5.
      - `multi_context`: `float`: Proportion of multi-context content, e.g., 0.4.
      - `reasoning`: `float`: Proportion of reasoning content, e.g., 0.1.
    - `generator_llm`: `dict`: Configuration of the generator LLM:
      - If using a local model, supports the following parameters:
        - `model_name_or_path`: `str`: Name or path of the generator model, e.g., "qwen/Qwen2-7B-Instruct" can be automatically downloaded from ModelScope; providing a path will load the model locally.
        - `template_type`: `str`: Template type, e.g., "qwen".
        - `generation_config`: `dict`: Generation configuration, e.g., `{"temperature": 0.7}`.
      - If using an API model, supports the following parameters:
        - `model_name`: `str`: Name of the custom model.
        - `api_base`: `str`: Base URL of the custom API, e.g., "http://127.0.0.1:8000".

    - `language`: `str`: Language, default is `english`, can be set to another language such as "chinese". The `generator_llm` will automatically translate prompts to the target language. The framework has pre-translated some prompts using `Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct`.

````{note}
`generator_llm` requires a model with strong instruction-following capabilities. Models with 7B parameters or fewer may encounter the following error during execution:
```
ragas.testset.transforms.engine - ERROR - unable to apply transformation: 'Generation' object has no attribute 'message'
```
This is because the model output format is incorrect, leading to parsing errors. In this case, please try using a larger model, such as `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4`, or proprietary models like `GPT-4o`.
````

### Configuration for Evaluation Task
```python
eval_task_cfg = {
    "eval_backend": "RAGEval",
    "eval_config": {
        "tool": "RAGAS",
        "eval": {
            "testset_file": "outputs/testset_with_answer.json",
            "critic_llm": {
                "model_name_or_path": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4",
                "template_type": "qwen",
            },
            "embeddings": {
                "model_name_or_path": "AI-ModelScope/m3e-base",
            },
            "metrics": [
                "Faithfulness",
                "AnswerRelevancy",
                "ContextPrecision",
                "AnswerCorrectness",
            ],
            "language": "english"
        },
    },
}
```
The basic parameters are consistent with those of the automatic evaluation task, with the following differences:
- `critic_llm`: Configuration for the evaluation model, parameters are the same as `generator_llm`.
- `testset_file`: Specifies the path to the evaluation dataset file, default is `outputs/testset_with_answer.json`.
- `metrics`: Specifies the evaluation metrics, refer to the [metrics list](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html).

### Execute Evaluation
```python
from evalscope.run import run_task
from evalscope.utils.logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger()

# Run task
run_task(task_cfg=eval_task_cfg)
```

The output evaluation results are as follows:

## Multi-Modal Text-Image RAG Evaluation

This framework extends RAG evaluation to support multi-modal text-image evaluation, accommodating text-image contexts.

### Dataset Preparation

```json
[
    {
        "user_input": "What is the brand of the car in the image?",
        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "custom_eval/multimodal/images/tesla.jpg"
        ],
        "response": "Tesla is a car brand.",
        "reference": "The car brand in the image is Tesla."
    },
    {
        "user_input": "What about Tesla Model X?",
        "retrieved_contexts": [
            "custom_eval/multimodal/images/tesla.jpg"
        ],
        "response": "Cats are cute.",
        "reference": "The Tesla Model X is an electric SUV manufactured by Tesla."
    }
]
```

The required fields include:
- user_input: User input
- response: Model generated answer
- retrieved_contexts: List of retrieved contexts, which can be text or image paths (local or URL)
- reference: Standard answer

### Configuring the Evaluation Task
```python
multi_modal_task_cfg = {
    "eval_backend": "RAGEval",
    "eval_config": {
        "tool": "RAGAS",
        "eval": {
            "testset_file": "outputs/testset_multi_modal.json",
            "critic_llm": {
                "model_name": "gpt-4o",
                "api_base": "http://127.0.0.1:8088/v1",
                "api_key": "EMPTY",
            },
            "embeddings": {
                "model_name_or_path": "AI-ModelScope/bge-large-zh",
            },
            "metrics": [
                "MultiModalFaithfulness",
                "MultiModalRelevance",
            ],
        },
    },
}
```
The basic parameters are consistent with the RAG evaluation task configuration. The differences are as follows:
- `critic_llm`: Configuration for the evaluation model, parameters are the same as `generator_llm`. The model needs to support multi-modal interleaved text-image input.
- `metrics`: Specifies the evaluation metrics. Currently supports `MultiModalFaithfulness` and `MultiModalRelevance` for multi-modal text-image evaluation. For other metrics that do not involve multi-modal data, such as `AnswerCorrectness`, please refer to the [metrics list](https://docs.ragas.io/en/latest/concepts/metrics/index.html).
- `embeddings` is an optional parameter and may be omitted.

```python
from evalscope.run import run_task

run_task(task_cfg=multi_modal_task_cfg)
```
