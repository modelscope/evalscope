# Welcome to the EvalScope Tutorial!

## Getting Started
To help users get up to speed quickly, we recommend the following process:
- For users who want to use EvalScope, we recommend first reading the [Quick Start](get_started/introduction.md) section to set up the environment and start a mini experiment to familiarize themselves with the process.
- For some basic usage, we suggest users read the [User Guides](user_guides/offline_evaluation.md), which include [How to Use EvalScope for Offline Evaluation](user_guides/offline_evaluation.md), [How to Use Arena Mode for Evaluation](user_guides/arena.md), [How to Use Other Evaluation Backends](user_guides/backend/index.md), and [How to Use the Model Service Stress Testing Tool](user_guides/stress_test.md).
- If you want to customize more modules, such as adding datasets and models, we provide an [Advanced Tutorial](advanced_guides/custom_dataset.md).
- Additionally, we offer [Third-Party Tools](third_party/toolbench.md) to help users quickly evaluate models, such as using ToolBench for evaluation.
- Finally, we provide [Best Practices](best_practice/swift_integration.md) to assist users in evaluation, such as how to use Swift for evaluation.
We always welcome PRs and issues from users to improve EvalScope.
