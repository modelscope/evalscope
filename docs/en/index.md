# Welcome to EvalScope Tutorial!

## Getting Started Guide

To help users get started quickly, we recommend the following process:

- For users who want to use EvalScope, we recommend reading the [Quick Start](get_started/introduction.md) section first to set up the environment and launch a mini experiment to familiarize yourself with the process.
- For basic usage, we suggest users read the Tutorial section, including [How to Use Arena Mode for Evaluation](user_guides/arena.md), [How to Use Other Evaluation Backends](user_guides/backend/index.md), and [How to Use Model Service Stress Testing Tool](user_guides/stress_test/index.md).
- If you want to customize more modules, such as adding datasets and models, we provide [Advanced Tutorials](advanced_guides/custom_dataset/index.md).
- In addition, we provide [Third-party Tools](third_party/toolbench.md) to help users quickly evaluate models, such as using ToolBench for evaluation.
- Finally, we provide [Best Practices](best_practice/swift_integration.md) to help users conduct evaluations, such as how to use Swift for evaluation.

We always welcome users' PRs and Issues to improve EvalScope.
