# ms-swift Integration

The evaluation capabilities of the [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) framework utilize the EvalScope evaluation framework from the ModelScope community and have been encapsulated to support the evaluation needs of various models. We currently support evaluation processes for **standard evaluation datasets** as well as **user-defined** evaluation datasets.
