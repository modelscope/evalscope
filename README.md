## 🎉 What's New

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Version 1.0 Refactoring**
>
> Version 1.0 introduces a major overhaul of the evaluation framework, establishing a new, more modular and extensible API layer under `evalscope/api`. Key improvements include standardized data models for benchmarks, samples, and results; a registry-based design for components such as benchmarks and metrics; and a rewritten core evaluator that orchestrates the new architecture. Existing benchmark adapters have been migrated to this API, resulting in cleaner, more consistent, and easier-to-maintain implementations.

## 🛠️ Environment Setup

We recommend using `conda` to create a virtual environment and install with `pip`.

1.  **Create and Activate Conda Environment** (Python 3.10 recommended)
    ```shell
    conda create -n evalscope python=3.10
    conda activate evalscope
    ```

2.  **Install EvalScope**

    - **Method 1: Install via PyPI (Recommended)**
      ```shell
      pip install evalscope
      ```

    - **Method 2: Install from Source (For Development)**
      ```shell
      git clone https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope.git
      cd evalscope
      pip install -e .
      ```

3.  **Install Additional Dependencies** (Optional)
    Install corresponding feature extensions according to your needs:
    ```shell
    # Performance testing
    pip install 'evalscope[perf]'

    # Visualization App
    pip install 'evalscope[app]'

    # Other evaluation backends
    pip install 'evalscope[opencompass]'
    pip install 'evalscope[vlmeval]'
    pip install 'evalscope[rag]'

    # Install all dependencies
    pip install 'evalscope[all]'
    ```
    > If you installed from source, please replace `evalscope` with `.`, for example `pip install '.[perf]'`.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was formerly known as `llmuses`. If you need to use `v0.4.3` or earlier versions, please run `pip install llmuses<=0.4.3` and use `from llmuses import ...` for imports.


## 🚀 Quick Start

You can start evaluation tasks in two ways: **command line** or **Python code**.

### Method 1. Using Command Line

Execute the `evalscope eval` command in any path to start evaluation. The following command will evaluate the `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` model on `gsm8k` and `arc` datasets, taking only 5 samples from each dataset.

```bash
evalscope eval \
 --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
 --datasets gsm8k arc \
 --limit 5
```

### Method 2. Using Python Code

Use the `run_task` function and `TaskConfig` object to configure and start evaluation tasks.

```python
from evalscope import run_task, TaskConfig

# Configure evaluation task
task_cfg = TaskConfig(
    model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct',
    datasets=['gsm8k', 'arc'],
    limit=5
)

# Start evaluation
run_task(task_cfg)
```

<details><summary><b>💡 Tip:</b> `run_task` also supports dictionaries, YAML or JSON files as configuration.</summary>

**Using Python Dictionary**

```python
from evalscope.run import run_task

task_cfg = {
    'model': 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct',
    'datasets': ['gsm8k', 'arc'],
    'limit': 5
}
run_task(task_cfg=task_cfg)
```

**Using YAML File** (`config.yaml`)
```yaml
model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
datasets:
  - gsm8k
  - arc
limit: 5
```
```python
from evalscope.run import run_task

run_task(task_cfg="config.yaml")
```
</details>

### Output Results
After evaluation completion, you will see a report in the terminal in the following format:
```text
+-----------------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+-------+---------+
| Model Name            | Dataset Name   | Metric Name     | Category Name   | Subset Name   |   Num |   Score |
+=======================+================+=================+=================+===============+=======+=========+
| Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct | gsm8k          | AverageAccuracy | default         | main          |     5 |     0.4 |
+-----------------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+-------+---------+
| Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct | ai2_arc        | AverageAccuracy | default         | ARC-Easy      |     5 |     0.8 |
+-----------------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+-------+---------+
| Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct | ai2_arc        | AverageAccuracy | default         | ARC-Challenge |     5 |     0.4 |
+-----------------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+-------+---------+
```

## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Custom Evaluation Parameters

You can fine-tune model loading, inference, and dataset configuration through command line parameters.

```shell
evalscope eval \
 --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
 --model-args '{"revision": "master", "precision": "torch.float16", "device_map": "auto"}' \
 --generation-config '{"do_sample":true,"temperature":0.6,"max_tokens":512}' \
 --dataset-args '{"gsm8k": {"few_shot_num": 0, "few_shot_random": false}}' \
 --datasets gsm8k \
 --limit 10
```

- `--model-args`: Model loading parameters such as `revision`, `precision`, etc.
- `--generation-config`: Model generation parameters such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, etc.
- `--dataset-args`: Dataset configuration parameters such as `few_shot_num`, etc.

For details, please refer to [📖 Complete Parameter Guide](https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/parameters.html).

### Evaluating Online Model APIs

EvalScope supports evaluating model services deployed via APIs (such as services deployed with vLLM). Simply specify the service address and API Key.

1.  **Start Model Service** (using vLLM as example)
    ```shell
    export VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=True
    python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server \
      --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
      --served-model-name qwen2.5 \
      --port 8801
    ```

2.  **Run Evaluation**
    ```shell
    evalscope eval \
     --model qwen2.5 \
     --eval-type service \
     --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8801/v1 \
     --api-key EMPTY \
     --datasets gsm8k \
     --limit 10
    ```

### ⚔️ Arena Mode

Arena mode evaluates model performance through pairwise battles between models, providing win rates and rankings, perfect for horizontal comparison of multiple models.

```text
# Example evaluation results
Model           WinRate (%)  CI (%)
------------  -------------  ---------------
qwen2.5-72b            69.3  (-13.3 / +12.2)
qwen2.5-7b             50    (+0.0 / +0.0)
qwen2.5-0.5b            4.7  (-2.5 / +4.4)
```

EvalScope provides a powerful stress testing tool for evaluating the performance of large language model services.

- **Key Metrics**: Supports throughput (Tokens/s), first token latency (TTFT), token generation latency (TPOT), etc.
- **Result Recording**: Supports recording results to `wandb` and `swanlab`.
- **Speed Benchmarks**: Can generate speed benchmark results similar to official reports.

For details, please refer to [📖 Performance Testing Usage Guide](https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/stress_test/index.html).
