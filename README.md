## 📝 Introduction

EvalScope is [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/)'s official framework for model evaluation and benchmarking, designed for diverse assessment needs. It supports various model types including large language models, multimodal, embedding, reranker, and CLIP models.

The framework accommodates multiple evaluation scenarios such as end-to-end RAG evaluation, arena mode, and inference performance testing. It features built-in benchmarks and metrics like MMLU, CMMLU, C-Eval, and GSM8K. Seamlessly integrated with the [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift) training framework, EvalScope enables one-click evaluations, offering comprehensive support for model training and assessment 🚀

</p>

<details><summary>Framework Description</summary>

The architecture includes the following modules:
1. **Model Adapter**: The model adapter is used to convert the outputs of specific models into the format required by the framework, supporting both API call models and locally run models.
2. **Data Adapter**: The data adapter is responsible for converting and processing input data to meet various evaluation needs and formats.
3. **Evaluation Backend**:
    - **Native**: EvalScope’s own **default evaluation framework**, supporting various evaluation modes, including single model evaluation, arena mode, baseline model comparison mode, etc.
    - **OpenCompass**: Supports [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass) as the evaluation backend, providing advanced encapsulation and task simplification, allowing you to submit tasks for evaluation more easily.
    - **VLMEvalKit**: Supports [VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) as the evaluation backend, enabling easy initiation of multi-modal evaluation tasks, supporting various multi-modal models and datasets.
    - **RAGEval**: Supports RAG evaluation, supporting independent evaluation of embedding models and rerankers using [MTEB/CMTEB](https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/backend/rageval_backend/mteb.html), as well as end-to-end evaluation using [RAGAS](https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guides/backend/rageval_backend/ragas.html).
    - **ThirdParty**: Other third-party evaluation tasks, such as ToolBench.
4. **Performance Evaluator**: Model performance evaluation, responsible for measuring model inference service performance, including performance testing, stress testing, performance report generation, and visualization.
5. **Evaluation Report**: The final generated evaluation report summarizes the model's performance, which can be used for decision-making and further model optimization.
6. **Visualization**: Visualization results help users intuitively understand evaluation results, facilitating analysis and comparison of different model performances.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/modelscope/evalscope.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```shell
   cd evalscope/

   ```


## 🚀 Quick Start

To evaluate a model on specified datasets using default configurations, this framework supports two ways to initiate evaluation tasks: using the command line or using Python code.

### Method 1. Using Command Line

Execute the `eval` command in any directory:
```bash
evalscope eval \
 --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
 --datasets gsm8k arc \
 --limit 5
```

### Method 2. Using Python Code

When using Python code for evaluation, you need to submit the evaluation task using the `run_task` function, passing a `TaskConfig` as a parameter. It can also be a Python dictionary, yaml file path, or json file path, for example:

**Using Python Dictionary**

```python
from evalscope.run import run_task

task_cfg = {
    'model': 'Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct',
    'datasets': ['gsm8k', 'arc'],
    'limit': 5
}

run_task(task_cfg=task_cfg)
```

<details><summary>More Startup Methods</summary>

**Using `TaskConfig`**

```python
from evalscope.run import run_task
from evalscope.config import TaskConfig

task_cfg = TaskConfig(
    model='Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct',
    datasets=['gsm8k', 'arc'],
    limit=5
)

run_task(task_cfg=task_cfg)
```

**Using `yaml` file**

`config.yaml`:
```yaml
model: Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct
datasets:
  - gsm8k
  - arc
limit: 5
```

```python
from evalscope.run import run_task

run_task(task_cfg="config.yaml")
```

**Using `json` file**

`config.json`:
```json
{
    "model": "Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct",
    "datasets": ["gsm8k", "arc"],
    "limit": 5
}
```

```python
from evalscope.run import run_task

run_task(task_cfg="config.json")
```
</details>

### Basic Parameter
- `--model`: Specifies the `model_id` of the model in [ModelScope](https://modelscope.cn/), which can be automatically downloaded, e.g., [Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct](https://modelscope.cn/models/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct/summary); or use the local path of the model, e.g., `/path/to/model`
- `--datasets`: Dataset names, supports inputting multiple datasets separated by spaces. Datasets will be automatically downloaded from modelscope. For supported datasets, refer to the [Dataset List](https://evalscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/supported_dataset.html)
- `--limit`: Maximum amount of evaluation data for each dataset. If not specified, it defaults to evaluating all data. Can be used for quick validation

### Output Results
```text
+-----------------------+----------------+-----------------+-----------------+---------------+-------+---------+
| Model Name            | Dataset Name   | Metric Name     | Category Name   | Subset Name   |   Num |   Score |

## 🌐 Evaluation of Specified Model API

Specify the model API service address (api_url) and API Key (api_key) to evaluate the deployed model API service. In this case, the `eval-type` parameter must be specified as `service`, for example:

For example, to launch a model service using [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm):

```shell
export VLLM_USE_MODELSCOPE=True && python -m vllm.entrypoints.openai.api_server --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct --served-model-name qwen2.5 --trust_remote_code --port 8801
```
Then, you can use the following command to evaluate the model API service:
```shell
evalscope eval \
 --model qwen2.5 \
 --api-url http://127.0.0.1:8801/v1 \
 --api-key EMPTY \
 --eval-type service \
 --datasets gsm8k \
 --limit 10
```

## ⚙️ Custom Parameter Evaluation

For more customized evaluations, such as customizing model parameters or dataset parameters, you can use the following command. The evaluation startup method is the same as simple evaluation. Below shows how to start the evaluation using the `eval` command:

```shell
evalscope eval \
 --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct \
 --model-args revision=master,precision=torch.float16,device_map=auto \
 --generation-config do_sample=true,temperature=0.5 \
 --dataset-args '{"gsm8k": {"few_shot_num": 0, "few_shot_random": false}}' \
 --datasets gsm8k \
 --limit 10
```

### Parameter
- `--model-args`: Model loading parameters, separated by commas in `key=value` format. Default parameters:
  - `revision`: Model version, default is `master`
  - `precision`: Model precision, default is `auto`
  - `device_map`: Model device allocation, default is `auto`
- `--generation-config`: Generation parameters, separated by commas in `key=value` format. Default parameters:
  - `do_sample`: Whether to use sampling, default is `false`
  - `max_length`: Maximum length, default is 2048
  - `max_new_tokens`: Maximum length of generation, default is 512
- `--dataset-args`: Configuration parameters for evaluation datasets, passed in `json` format. The key is the dataset name, and the value is the parameters. Note that it needs to correspond one-to-one with the values in the `--datasets` parameter:
  - `few_shot_num`: Number of few-shot examples
  - `few_shot_random`: Whether to randomly sample few-shot data, if not set, defaults to `true`
