    "description": "\n## Overview\n\nMRCR (Memory-Recall with Contextual Retrieval) is OpenAI's benchmark for evaluating retrieval and recall capabilities in long-context scenarios. It tests whether models can correctly extract and use specific information (needles) embedded in long prompts.\n\n## Task Description\n\n- **Task Type**: Long-Context Memory and Retrieval\n- **Input**: Long chat conversation with 2, 4, or 8 embedded needles\n- **Output**: Exact retrieval of needle content\n- **Domains**: Long-context understanding, information retrieval\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Tests retrieval with varying needle counts (2, 4, or 8)\n- Evaluates across multiple context length bins (4K to 1M tokens)\n- Measures exact recall of embedded information\n- Uses sequence ratio scoring for precise matching\n- Supports configurable context size filtering\n\n## Evaluation Notes\n\n- Default evaluation uses the **train** split\n- Primary metric: **MRCR Score** (sequence ratio)\n- Results bucketed by token count:\n  - 4K-8K, 8K-16K, 16K-32K, 32K-64K\n  - 64K-128K, 128K-256K, 256K-512K, 512K-1M\n- Configurable via extra_params: max/min_context_size, needle_count, tokenizer\n- Uses tiktoken for accurate token counting\n",

It tests whether models can correctly extract and use specific information (needles) embedded in long prompts.\n\n## Task Description\n\n- **Task Type**: Long-Context Memory and Retrieval\n- **Input**: Long chat conversation with 2, 4, or 8 embedded needles\n- **Output**: Exact retrieval of needle content\n- **Domains**: Long-context understanding, information retrieval\n\n## Key Features\n\n- Tests retrieval with varying needle counts (2, 4, or 8)\n- Evaluates across multiple context length bins (4K to 1M tokens)\n- Measures exact recall of embedded information\n- Uses sequence ratio scoring for precise matching\n- Supports configurable context size filtering\n\n## Evaluation Notes\n\n- Default evaluation uses the **train** split\n- Primary metric: **MRCR Score** (sequence ratio)\n- Results bucketed by token count:\n  - 4K-8K, 8K-16K, 16K-32K, 32K-64K\n  - 64K-128K, 128K-256K, 256K-512K, 512K-1M\n- Configurable via extra_params: max/min_context_size, needle_count, tokenizer\n- Uses tiktoken for accurate token counting\n\n\n## Properties\n\n| Property | Value |\n|----------|-------|\n| **Benchmark Name** | `openai_mrcr` |\n| **Dataset ID** | [openai-mirror/mrcr](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/openai-mirror/mrcr/summary) |\n| **Paper** | N/A |\n| **Tags** | `LongContext`, `Retrieval` |\n| **Metrics** | `mrcr_score` |\n| **Default Shots** | 0-shot |\n| **Evaluation Split** | `train` |\n\n\n## Data Statistics\n\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Total Samples | 2,400 |\n| Prompt Length (Mean) | 944363.11 chars |\n| Prompt Length (Min/Max) | 15459 / 5244934 chars |\n\n## Sample Example\n\n**Subset**: `default`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"input\": [\n    {\n      \"id\": \"4c6528c6\",\n      \"content\": \"Here are some examples of conversations succeeded by a follow-up question answered correctly:\\n\\n======EXAMPLE======\\nUser: write a short essay about education\\nAssistant: Education is a cornerstone of society, serving as the foundation upon whic ...
