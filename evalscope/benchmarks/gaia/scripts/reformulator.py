Read the above conversation and output a FINAL ANSWER to the question. The question is repeated here for convenience:

{original_task}

To output the final answer, use the following template: FINAL ANSWER: [YOUR FINAL ANSWER]
Your FINAL ANSWER should be a number OR as few words as possible OR a comma separated list of numbers and/or strings.
ADDITIONALLY, your FINAL ANSWER MUST adhere to any formatting instructions specified in the original question (e.g., alphabetization, sequencing, units, rounding, decimal places, etc.)
If you are asked for a number, express it numerically (i.e., with digits rather than words), don't use commas, and DO NOT INCLUDE UNITS such as $ or USD or percent signs unless specified otherwise.
If you are asked for a string, don't use articles or abbreviations (e.g. for cities), unless specified otherwise. Don't output any final sentence punctuation such as '.', '!', or '?'.
If you are asked for a comma separated list, apply the above rules depending on whether the elements are numbers or strings.
If you are unable to determine the final answer, output 'FINAL ANSWER: Unable to determine'
