DESCRIPTION = (
    'Drivelology, a unique linguistic phenomenon characterised as "nonsense with depth" - '

#Instruction#:
Classify whether the given text is a Drivelology sample or not.

#Definition#:
- Drivelology: Statements that appear logically coherent but contain deeper, often paradoxical meanings.
These challenge conventional interpretation by blending surface-level nonsense with underlying depth,
often incorporating elements of humor, irony, or sarcasm, and requiring contextual understanding and
emotional insight to unravel their true significance.
- non-Drivelology: This includes pure nonsense (grammatically correct but semantically meaningless
statements, such as "Colourless green ideas sleep furiously") and normal sentences, including quotes
or proverbs, that convey clear or straightforward information without the layered complexity
characteristic of Drivelology.

#Output Format#:
You should try your best to answer "Yes" if the given input text is Drivelology, otherwise specify "No".
The answer you give MUST be \"Yes\" or \"No\"".

#Input Text#: {text}
