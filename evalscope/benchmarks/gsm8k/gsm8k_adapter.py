Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should display the answer enclosed within \\boxed{{\\text{{$ANSWER}}}}.

Example:

Let's solve the problem step by step.

Problem: Eliza's rate per hour for the first 40 hours she works each week is $10. She also receives an overtime pay of 1.2 times her regular hourly rate. If Eliza worked for 45 hours this week, how much are her earnings for this week?

Step 1: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the first 40 hours. Eliza's hourly rate is $10, so her earnings for the first 40 hours are $10/hour x 40 hours = $400.
Step 2: Calculate Eliza's overtime pay rate. Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate, so her overtime pay rate is $10/hour x 1.2 = $12/hour.
Step 3: Calculate Eliza's earnings for the overtime hours. Eliza worked for 45 hours, so her overtime hours are 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours. Her earnings for the overtime hours are $12/hour x 5 hours = $60.
Step 4: Calculate Eliza's total earnings for the week. Eliza's total earnings for the week are her earnings for the first 40 hours plus her earnings for the overtime hours, which is $400 + $60 = $460.

Answer:
\\boxed{{\\text{{460}}}}

question:
{question}

Remember to put your answer on its own line at the end in the form "\\boxed{{\\text{{$ANSWER}}}}" (without quotes), where $ANSWER is replaced by the actual answer to the problem.
